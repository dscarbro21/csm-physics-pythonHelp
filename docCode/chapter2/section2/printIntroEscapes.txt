$> python printIntroEscapes.py
Python has "escape characters"
- which were used to print quotes in a string defined with quotes

Instead of empty prints, I can print newlines
 - with \n

I can put them
anywhere
in the string

notice that \ only affects the next character
I can even change the end with these

or separate     inputs with     tabs

Adjust both "sep"       and     "end" as you wish

Common escape characters:
\n \t \\ \' \"

Other more specialized ones also exist

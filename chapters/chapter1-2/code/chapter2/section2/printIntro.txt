$> python printIntro.py
print function basics:
Each statement prints on a new line
unless I tell it not to with the end= parameter
- Because by default end is set to a newline

an empty print still uses the default end parameter

I can end with spaces   or dashes---or anything I need to!!!!!

I can print two things together with a comma
- and if they are strings I can omit the comma
- or I can use the + operator
-- but not with variables! we saw that in the variables section.

If I want something specific between inputs, I can do that:
using the--sep--parameter
But I have to use commas to do so

As long as I use quotes for strings, I can use an apostrophe '
but if I use single quotes, I cannot, but I can use "quotes"
- we'll see how to get around this later

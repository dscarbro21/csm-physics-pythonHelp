# Python Guide
Welcome to the CSM Physics Python Guide! This repository is a work in progress, with lots of planned content to come!

This Python guide is currently being developed by Daniel Scarbrough and Nick Materise

*Readme updated Feb 18 2021*

## Navigating
Chapters giving an in-depth guide from installation of Python to advanced topics can be found in the **chapters** folder. Each chapter folder will contain:
* The chapter pdf
* The $\LaTeX$ file used to make the pdf
* A **code** folder. 

Inside the **code** folder, broken down by chapter and section you will find the Python files referenced in the pdf, as well as a .txt file showing the Terminal output when each Python script is run.
